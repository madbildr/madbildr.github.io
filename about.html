        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Lausse The Cat, is an elusive figure in the music industry. He first started making music in 2015, under the alias Blu Man, he then transitioned to making beats as Don Papa, then his full blown music career as lausse the cat began in 2016 until 2019.
            The last time he was heard from was the end of 2019. He has had no presence since then. His fans provide conspiracies and appreciate his music on the dedicated subreddit
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LausseTheCat/">r/laussethecat</a>.

        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Lausse The Cat was most likely born and raised in London, as he makes many references to the streets of London in his songs. However, he may have also spent a portion of his childhood in France
            as he was born to French parents.
        </p>
        <h2>So... Where is he now?</h2>
        <p>
            Lets cut the bullshit, this is the question on everyone's mind. Lausse is most likely living in the south of France, in a villa owned by his family. I know this isn't the most satisfying ending, but I will update the site if there is any word of him
            being back on the music scene.
