            Lausse The Cat, pictured above with B-ahwe, is an elusive figure in the music industry. He first started making music in 2015, under the alias Blu Man, he then transitioned to making beats as Don Papa, then his full blown music career as lausse the cat began in 2016 until 2019.
            The last time he was heard from was the end of 2019. He has had no presence since then. His fans provide conspiracies and appreciate his musci on the deciated subreddit
